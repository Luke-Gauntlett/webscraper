The 8 pole rotor is built around the<br/>tungsten or titanium shaft. This static and dynamic balanced rotor consists of 16 high quality neodymium super magnets. The<br/>rotor is protected by a composite layer of aramid fiber reinforced carbon. Both ends have double shaft seal with smooth<br/>bearings which sit in a resonance free silicon bedding. As well as making theses pumps capable of handling seawater it also<br/>prevents vibrations which can be sensitive to some invertebrates and koi.</p>\n<p><br/>STATOR<br/>The 27 poles stator not only gives an equal propulsion, due to the True Sine Wave technique it also has<br/>an unmatched torque.</p>\n<p><br/>PUMP HOUSING<br/>The pump housing is made from blended ABS and PC (polycarbonate) that unifies the positive features of both<br/>materials. Inside the housing the stator is fully cast in epoxy resin is protected by a strong layer of aramid fiber<br/>reinforced carbon.</p>\n<p><br/>POWER MODULE<br/>The power module uses True Sine Wave technology for high reliability. Unlike brushless DC motors with square wave<br/>technique, BLUE ECO pumps use True Sine Wave technology for the best features: high efficiency (90%), noise free<br/>running, high torque, wide RPM range, CO2 reduction.</p>\n<p><br/>BEARINGS<br/>For pumps, the bearing system is the most important part for reliability and life span. Blue Eco pumps have a<br/>diamond-hard bearing system of doped silicon carbide with or without the combination of the super strong<br/>and durable tungsten. The use of these high quality materials are unique and exclusive for these pumps and<br/>guarantee a long and trouble free operation.</p>\n<p><br/>LEAKAGE FREE<br/>The way BLUE ECO pumps are constructed prevents any internal leakage. The rotor rotates in the same<br/>water that lubricates the bearings. With a unique rinse-system, different for both models, the water inside<br/>will be continuously changed during operation.</p>\n<p><br/>WATERPROOF<br/>The pump is completely waterproof confirming to class IP68 (up to 12 meters of water head).</p>\n<p><br/>CABLE<br/>The cables on the BLUE ECO have extra protection for maximum safety in case of damage. The outer mantle<br/>is made of TPE and is fully saltwater proof. Due to this cable the pump can be fully submersible in (sea)water.</p>\n<p><br/>CONTROLLER<br/>The controller is developed by Estrad BV and produced under supervision of the University of Shenzen,<br/>China. This leading university is working close together with Europe‚‚¾‚s biggest companies and universities in<br/>this area.</p>\n<p><br/>CERTIFICATION<br/>The Blue Eco pump is the only pump in its class that has both the European CE certifications as well as the<br/>German ‚‚¦T™¦V Pr™‚¼fungs and Test Certificate‚‚½. This guarantees extra quality and safety.</p>\n<p><br/>TEST PROCEDURES<br/>The University of Shenzen supplies the software for the controllers and every controller is individually<br/>checked and certified. Every pump also undergoes an extensive test procedure and comes with its own<br/>unique test certificate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/blue240and320_2048x2048.png?v=1544089563\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The parting line at 240 Watt shows, where the capacity of the 240 Watt pump stops.

Due to their durability and extreme low power consumption they have conquered a steady position in many ponds. All Blue Eco pumps are saltwater proof!</p>\n<p><strong>240/320 watt</strong><br/>The 240/320 use the same pump but have different controllers. A 240 watt model is a 320 pump with a 240 watt controller. This controller is similar to the 320 watt controller but has a smaller True Sine Wave power module.<br/>Connections 240/320: inlet 2½‚‚½ male thr., outlet: 50/63mm. As of 2016, these models are provided with timer programs, cruise control and dry running protection.</p>\n<p><strong>500/900/1500/2200 watt</strong><br/>These models are suited for the heavier work. Also this controller offers many extra options, like 5 timer programs that can control the<br/>pump capacity and duration, the cruise control option and a full automatic protection against dry running. Even the possibility for a<br/>second, external, control panel for remote control can be installed. Like the 240/320, the display shows the hour counter, power<br/>consumption, amperage and RPM but also offers a vast number of messages to indicate problems, etc. A Blue Eco pump can pay for<br/>itself within one year. Up to 50% less energy consumption, thus environmental friendly and good for CO2 reduction.<br/>Connections: 500/900/1500/2200: inlet 2½‚‚½ male thr., outlet: 2‚‚½ male thr. Blue Eco 500/900/2200 with 4FLOW pump head: 3‚‚½ Male<br/>threaded (inlet and outlet).</p>\n<p><strong>FLEXIBLE</strong><br/>Blue Eco pumps are very easy to install with flexible fittings. This simplifies maintenance<br/>but also takes care of a resonance/vibration free and noise suppressing setup!<br/>Attention! Use max. 1 extension cable per pump.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p><strong>The FlowFriend <br/></strong>The standard FlowFriend has a mixed- ow pump housing, a type that is also often used at pumping stations. Its optimal field of application is for a pump lift of between 1 and 5 metres. The hydraulics have been designed such that greater pressure is available than with an axial (propeller) pump. As a result, signifcantly less energy is used in comparison to pumps of similar capacity. Almost all pumps with high capacity have more than 10 metres of pressure. This high available pressure uses a great deal of energy. If there is higher back pressure to any extent, resulting for example from longer hose lengths, numerous bends and difference in height, then this ‘standard’ FlowFriend is the optimal choice. The FlowFriend has a 3” screw thread connection at both the suction and the pressure sides.</p>\n<p><strong>Motor and seal<br/></strong>The FlowFriend has a very high-quality Eagle Burgmann shaft seal. The motor has been designed in-house and is manufactured by one of Germany’s largest and most important producers of electrical motors. The motor’s efficiency, depending on the RPMs, is between 88 and 94%.</p>\n<p><strong>Dry-running or submersible pumps</strong><br/>The FlowFriend is a dry-running pump with a sealed shaft. This technology is superior from an energy and safety perspective to submersible pumps (in which the pump’s shaft rotates in water). This is why almost all pumps used for industrial applications are pumps with a sealed shaft. As with dry running pumps, the shaft and the stator are positioned extremely close to each other, they have signifcantly lower energy loss in operation by comparison with submersible pumps. Submersible pumps always require a compromise. If the distance between the stator and the shaft is very small, there is a high risk of damage due to dirt that is stuck between the shaft and the stator. However, as this distance increases, the pump’s energy losses increase quadratically.<br/>If the stator in a submersible pump becomes damaged, direct contact between the core (with voltages exceeding 300V) and the water is possible. This is why a submersible pump is not recommended for applications in which people touch the water or swim in it.</p>\n<p><strong>The FlowFriend Series:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>extremely energy efficient</li>\n<li>standard  ow/rpm controls</li>\n<li>optional 0-10V control</li>\n<li>high flows at low energy consumption</li>\n<li>extremely quiet</li>\n<li>a highly efficient new generation of permanent magnet motor</li>\n<li>3 different optimised pump housings, cast completely of stainless steel grade 316</li>\n<li>optimal adjustment for versatile application</li>\n<li>a premium efficiency IE4 motor</li>\n<li>can be used anywhere in the world ranging from 100-240V/50-60Hz</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Technical Data</h1>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Weight (kg)</span></td>\n<td><span>14.2</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Country of manufacture</span></td>\n<td><span>Netherlands</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Pressure max.</span></td>\n<td><span>7.0 m1</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Max. flow (m3/hour)</span></td>\n<td><span>70</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Outlet (mm)</span></td>\n<td><span>3\" BSP / 3\" BSP</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Protection Class</span></td>\n<td><span>IP55</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Dimensions (mm)</span></td>\n<td><span>367x236x258</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Material</span></td>\n<td> <span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">aisi 304 stainless steel</span>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>The most important difference in the construction of the pump is that the motor and the control electronics are separated from each other. The motor complies with IP class 67 because the pump does not need a cooling fan. The electronics can be assembled in an easily accessible place and can be controlled remotely in a number of ways. The control cabinet, pump and cable are fully EMC-shielded.</p>\n<p>The extremely efficient design of the pump has been retained. This means that hydraulic, motor and control electronics losses are all minimised.<br/>The maximum efficiency of the hydraulics at full load is above 85%, that of the motor above 94% and for the control above 98%. The motor suffices with regard to the most recent, not yet officially released IE6 standard for energy efficiency. </p>\n<p>The hydraulics in the Junior are, just like in the other FlowFriend pumps, made of 316 stainless steel and of the mixed-flow type. This means a pump head of up to 5.5 metres and a flow adjustable to 40 m3/h so the pump has a large area of application for efficient use. The pump is fully adjustable (500-3000 rpm) using an external control system.</p>\n<p>The control electronics<br/>The FlowFriend is supplied with short-circuit resistant control electronics and has as standard:</p>\n<p> • keypad<br/> • short-circuit resistance<br/> • internal EMC filter<br/> • Modbus RTU<br/> • CANopen<br/> • analogue inputs (0-10V/0-20mA/4-20mA)<br/> • digital inputs<br/> • IP66</p>\n<p>The power consumption can also be read off with this control unit. The Junior can be remotely controlled using the many analogue and digital inputs.</p>\n<h1>Technical Data</h1>\n<table class=\"data table additional-attributes\" id=\"product-attribute-specs-table\">\n<caption class=\"table-caption\"><br/></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Weight (kg)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Weight (kg)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">11.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Brand</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Brand\" style=\"text-align: left;\">FlowFriend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Country of manufacture</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Country of manufacture\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Netherlands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Power (W)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Power (W)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">25-390</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Pressure max.</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Pressure max.\" style=\"text-align: left;\">5,5 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Max. flow (m3/hour)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Max. flow (m3/hour)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Inlet (mm)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Inlet (mm)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">2,5\"BSP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Outlet (mm)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Outlet (mm)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">2,5\"BSP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Protection Class</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Protection Class\" style=\"text-align: left;\">IP67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Dimensions (mm)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Dimensions (mm)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">264x188x201</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Material</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Material\" style=\"text-align: left;\">aisi 304 stainless steel</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

The FlowFriend PRO has a suction/pression connection of no less than 12 mm in order to minimise the internal pump by this means. The PRO can deal with signifcantly higher pressure than so-called 'air-lift' based systems, and the PRO is outstandingly flexible in use on account of its adjustability.

The 8 pole rotor is built around the<br/>tungsten or titanium shaft. This static and dynamic balanced rotor consists of 16 high quality neodymium super magnets. The<br/>rotor is protected by a composite layer of aramid fiber reinforced carbon. Both ends have double shaft seal with smooth<br/>bearings which sit in a resonance free silicon bedding. As well as making theses pumps capable of handling seawater it also<br/>prevents vibrations which can be sensitive to some invertebrates and koi.</p>\n<p><br/>STATOR<br/>The 27 poles stator not only gives an equal propulsion, due to the True Sine Wave technique it also has<br/>an unmatched torque.</p>\n<p><br/>PUMP HOUSING<br/>The pump housing is made from blended ABS and PC (polycarbonate) that unifies the positive features of both<br/>materials. Inside the housing the stator is fully cast in epoxy resin is protected by a strong layer of aramid fiber<br/>reinforced carbon.</p>\n<p><br/>POWER MODULE<br/>The power module uses True Sine Wave technology for high reliability. Unlike brushless DC motors with square wave<br/>technique, BLUE ECO pumps use True Sine Wave technology for the best features: high efficiency (90%), noise free<br/>running, high torque, wide RPM range, CO2 reduction.</p>\n<p><br/>BEARINGS<br/>For pumps, the bearing system is the most important part for reliability and life span. Blue Eco pumps have a<br/>diamond-hard bearing system of doped silicon carbide with or without the combination of the super strong<br/>and durable tungsten. The use of these high quality materials are unique and exclusive for these pumps and<br/>guarantee a long and trouble free operation.</p>\n<p><br/>LEAKAGE FREE<br/>The way BLUE ECO pumps are constructed prevents any internal leakage. The rotor rotates in the same<br/>water that lubricates the bearings. With a unique rinse-system, different for both models, the water inside<br/>will be continuously changed during operation.</p>\n<p><br/>WATERPROOF<br/>The pump is completely waterproof confirming to class IP68 (up to 12 meters of water head).</p>\n<p><br/>CABLE<br/>The cables on the BLUE ECO have extra protection for maximum safety in case of damage. The outer mantle<br/>is made of TPE and is fully saltwater proof. Due to this cable the pump can be fully submersible in (sea)water.</p>\n<p><br/>CONTROLLER<br/>The controller is developed by Estrad BV and produced under supervision of the University of Shenzen,<br/>China. This leading university is working close together with Europe‚‚¾‚s biggest companies and universities in<br/>this area.</p>\n<p><br/>CERTIFICATION<br/>The Blue Eco pump is the only pump in its class that has both the European CE certifications as well as the<br/>German ‚‚¦T™¦V Pr™‚¼fungs and Test Certificate‚‚½. This guarantees extra quality and safety.</p>\n<p><br/>TEST PROCEDURES<br/>The University of Shenzen supplies the software for the controllers and every controller is individually<br/>checked and certified. Every pump also undergoes an extensive test procedure and comes with its own<br/>unique test certificate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/blue240and320_2048x2048.png?v=1544089563\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The parting line at 240 Watt shows, where the capacity of the 240 Watt pump stops.

Above this line the values are only valid for the 2200 Watt version.</strong></p>\n<p>Since their introduction in 2010 it is hard to imagine the current pond World without Blue Eco pumps. Due to their durability and extreme low power consumption they have conquered a steady position in many ponds. All Blue Eco pumps are saltwater proof!</p>\n<p><strong>240/320 watt</strong><br/>The 240/320 use the same pump but have different controllers. A 240 watt model is a 320 pump with a 240 watt controller. This controller is similar to the 320 watt controller but has a smaller True Sine Wave power module.<br/>Connections 240/320: inlet 2½‚‚½ male thr., outlet: 50/63mm. As of 2016, these models are provided with timer programs, cruise control and dry running protection.</p>\n<p><strong>500/900/1500/2200 watt</strong><br/>These models are suited for the heavier work. Also this controller offers many extra options, like 5 timer programs that can control the<br/>pump capacity and duration, the cruise control option and a full automatic protection against dry running. Even the possibility for a<br/>second, external, control panel for remote control can be installed. Like the 240/320, the display shows the hour counter, power<br/>consumption, amperage and RPM but also offers a vast number of messages to indicate problems, etc. A Blue Eco pump can pay for<br/>itself within one year. Up to 50% less energy consumption, thus environmental friendly and good for CO2 reduction.<br/>Connections: 500/900/1500/2200: inlet 2½‚‚½ male thr., outlet: 2‚‚½ male thr. Blue Eco 500/900/2200 with 4FLOW pump head: 3‚‚½ Male<br/>threaded (inlet and outlet).</p>\n<p><strong>FLEXIBLE</strong><br/>Blue Eco pumps are very easy to install with flexible fittings. This simplifies maintenance<br/>but also takes care of a resonance/vibration free and noise suppressing setup!<br/>Attention! Use max. 1 extension cable per pump.</p>\n",

This causes the water to splash down on the filter medium like a shower. This method causes the water to break up and absorb a great deal of oxygen: ideal for a biological system that demands a high level of oxygen. This is why a trickle filter starts up faster than other filters, such as multi-chamber systems or bead filters. It therefore stands to reason that this is the system of choice for most cultivation farms.</p>\n<p><br/>The recommended flow rate to the system is 20,000lph, and the water outlet is through a weir at the bottom, so this needs to be situation at the pond edge to return the water.</p>\n<p>Dimensions - Height 100cm / Width 97cm / Depth 44cm (69cm inc blade)<br/>Inlet size - 1.5” (Black waste pipe)</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>Water from the pond enters the EazyPod Complete via the inlet, cascading around the 18 Watt UV-C bulb, where any algae will be exposed to the UV-C radiation.</p>\n<p>The water then flows around the circumference of the outer chamber of the EazyPod Complete, passing through the stainless steel grill causing many of the larger solids to be filtered out and settle in the base of the outer chamber. This is the first stage of mechanical filtration.</p>\n<p>As water enters the central chamber, through the stainless steel grill, the fine smaller solids become trapped in the mass of K1 Micro. Bio-films build up on the protected surface area within each piece of media, allowing biological filtration to take place.</p>\n<p>After passing through the K1 Micro, the clean water then rises and overflows into the inner return pipe and flows back to the pond via the outlet.</p>\n<p>The EazyPod Complete is incredibly simple to clean. The connected air pump is used during the cleaning cycle to agitate the K1 Micro to free up any debris and waste that has built up within the filter.</p>\n<p>All EazyPod Complete models are supplied with a 70 litre per minute air pump and accessory kit.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>Introducing the EazyPod, a compact marvel within the Nexus family, meticulously designed for pond enthusiasts with water features up to 10,000 litres. This exceptional mechanical and biological filter system ensures your aquatic haven thrives with crystal-clear water.</p>\n<p>Harnessing the power of 18 litres of static K1 Micro, the EazyPod delivers superior biological benefits, transforming into a powerhouse of cleanliness even when utilized solely as a mechanical waste filter. As water gracefully enters through the inlet, it embarks on a journey around the outer chamber. The stainless steel grill acts as a gatekeeper, swiftly filtering out larger solids that settle at the chamber's base – a meticulous dance in the realm of mechanical filtration.</p>\n<p>The second act unfolds as water ventures into the central chamber, navigating the stainless steel grill once more. Here, the finer particles find themselves ensnared in the embrace of the K1 Micro. Within each piece of this cutting-edge media, bio-films flourish on protected surfaces, paving the way for unparalleled biological filtration. The clean water, having undergone this transformative process, ascends and gracefully overflows into the inner return pipe, embarking on its journey back to the pond via the outlet.</p>\n<p>Cleaning the EazyPod is a breeze, thanks to its ingenious design. Employing the connected air pump during the cleaning cycle, the K1 Micro is stirred and rejuvenated, liberating any accumulated debris and waste. For optimal results, we recommend a 70-litre-per-minute air pump during the cleaning cycle – a touch of maintenance magic.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that only the EazyPodAir and EazyPod Complete models come complete with a 70-litre-per-minute air pump and accessory kit, ensuring you have all the tools at your fingertips for a seamless aquatic experience.

    "description_text": "\n<p>By showering the pond water over the media within this Shower system you improve the<br/>dissolved oxygen content and help gas off carbon dioxide. A trickle filter’s operating principle is very simple. The water is pumped up and then well distributed across a perforated surface. This causes the water to splash down on the filter medium like a shower. This method causes the water to break up and absorb a great deal of oxygen: ideal for a biological system that demands a high level of oxygen. This is why a trickle filter starts up faster than other filters, such as multi-chamber systems or bead filters. It therefore stands to reason that this is the system of choice for most cultivation farms.</p>\n<p><br/>The recommended flow rate to the system is 20,000lph, and the water outlet is through a weir<span> </span>at the bottom, so this needs to be situation at the pond edge to return the water.</p>\n<p>Dimensions - Height 100cm / Width 97cm / Depth 44cm (69cm inc blade)<br/>Inlet size - 1.5” (Black waste pipe)</p>\n",

First the<br/>\nwater is forced through the sponges (mechanical filtration) and then<br/>\nthrough the bioballs (biological filtration) in combination with an<br/>\neffective UVC sterilizer lamp to guarantee clear pond water. In the<br/>\nlarger models (60&amp;100), there is only biological filtration with<br/>\nfilterfoam and not with bioballs. Cleaning: - lift the handle on the top of<br/>\nthe cover; 2 -turn the lateral grip handles in the cleaning position and<br/>\nturn the flow selector handle; 3 - push the big handle down to squeeze<br/>\nand clean the internal sponges (PATENTED<br/>\nMECHANISM). There is no need to open the filter, you can<br/>\nclean it with clean and dry hands! Max. pond size is based on<br/>\nsmall fish load. For ponds with high fish load you need to reduce the<br/>\nmax. size with 50%.

    "description_text": "\n<p>The Eazy Pod Automatic is a self-cleaning, mechanical and biological filter system for garden ponds up to 10,000 litres.</p>\n<p>The integrated control box contains an adjustable timer which initiates a cleaning cycle automatically - meaning your filter will clean itself even when you’re not there!</p>\n<p>Inside the control box, the electronic connector blocks control the automated waste valve, along with your choice of circulating pump (not supplied).</p>\n<p>Crystal clear, healthy water is achieved by K1 Micro filter media, which also provides enhanced biological benefits by way of its protected surface area.</p>\n<p>The Eazy pod UV Automatic features an integrated 18 Watt UVC built in to the inlet section of the filter, helping to clear green water. </p>\n<p>How the Eazy Pod Automatic works.</p>\n<p>The concept of the Eazy Pod Automatic is simple and yet innovative. Water enters via the inlet and passes over an 18 watt UV Clarifying bulb helping to kill any single celled algae in the water. </p>\n<p>The water then enters the outer chamber, which runs around the entire circumference of the Eazy Pod. Between the outer chamber and the inner chamber, there is a stainless steel perforated screen. These perforations are situated in the lower half of the screen and around its entire face. This means that when the water passes from the outer to inner chamber, a downward and upward flow is created. This causes many of the larger solids to settle in the base of the outer chamber, due to the force of gravity.</p>\n<p>The size of the perforations will not allow large mechanical waste to enter the inner chamber, thus acting as a first stage mechanical filter. The inner chamber holds 18 litres of static K1 Micro media. As the water enters the inner chamber, the fine smaller solids become entrapped in the K1 Micro. After passing through the K1 Micro, the clean water then rises and overflows into the inner return pipe. From here it returns to the pond via the return outlet.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>UltraSieve filters are the most reliable pre-filters on the market. This is partly due to the simple design, with just one moving part. The pre-filter is not self-cleaning, but it is very easy to maintain. Open the slide valve and the debris can be washed away. The UltraSieve pre-filters have a stainless steel filter element that never needs to be replaced. Thanks to the triangular stainless steel rods at a 7° angle, the water falls directly through the sieve, but the debris remains. A major advantage of this principle is that the debris is truly removed from the water circulation. This is highly beneficial to the water quality, because waste products are no longer polluting the water.</p>\n<p>How it works<br/>The pond water flows over the top of moving weir. This moving weir is connected to a float, so the height of this weir is controlled automatically. This level feedback mechanism ensures that the exact amount of water that is pumped enters again. The sieve consists of hundreds of triangular rods spaced 0.2 or 0.3 mm (200 or 300 microns) apart. The rods are slightly angled so the coarser particles remain on the sieve and the ‘sieved’ water falls through. The sieved water is led further to the main filter.</p>\n<p>Why UltraSieve pre-filters?<br/>• The most efficient pre-filter (swimming)ponds<br/>• Reliable! (only one moving part)<br/>• Stainless steel filter element<br/>• Waste is directly separated from the water circulation<br/>• No noise<br/>• No water loss<br/>• Waste can be 100% recycled<br/>• Very easy to maintain<br/>• Ideal for swimming ponds!<br/>• Market leader for over 15 years</p>\n<p>Technical specifications:<br/>• The pump connection is fitted standard with a long suction pipe that draws in the water from beneath the float so that no air is drawn in.<br/>• 2 or 3 inlets 110 mm.<br/>• Patented flow control.<br/>• Large debris outlet incl. slide valve 90/110 mm.<br/>• Strong polypropylene housing.<br/>• Lid available separately. </p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>The SuperSieve Pump Fed system offers a straightforward solution for removing larger particles of dirt (over 0.2 mm) from pond water. Specifically designed for ponds where the pump resides within the pond itself, this system efficiently filters dirty water before it reaches a biological filter.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the SuperSieve Pump is its specialized industrial curved screens. These screens consist of razor-sharp triangular rods angled in relation to each other, incorporating a precise 300-micron (0.3 mm) slit. As water flows against the sharp edges of the triangles, surface tension is broken, allowing dirt particles to be pushed away from the screen and lifted out of the water. The dirt then slides down the screen until it collects in the SuperSieve's dirt gutter.</p>\n<p>Comprising two main parts - the pre-chamber and the chamber housing the screen element - the SuperSieve optimizes dirt separation and flow through the screen. The closed pre-chamber directs water at right angles to the screen element, enhancing dirt separation and increasing flow. Additionally, the design ensures that separated dirt is pushed towards the dirt gutter.</p>\n<p>The screen element is meticulously sealed with specially manufactured rubbers on the housing to prevent unfiltered water or dirt from passing through. A lid on the housing minimizes noise and inhibits the growth of algae and bacteria on the screen element, maintaining optimal filtration performance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Small dimensions (lxwxh = 42x39x60)</span></li>\n<li>\n<span>Up to 20m</span><sup><span>3</span></sup><span>/hour</span>\n</li>\n<li><span>Large return connections</span></li>\n<li><span>Inc. dirt discharge gutter</span></li>\n<li><span>Inc. lid</span></li>\n<li><span>Large screen element (32cm wide/47cm long)</span></li>\n<li><span>2x75/110mm outlet</span></li>\n<li><span>2x 63mm inlet</span></li>\n<li><span>2x 75mm overflow protection</span></li>\n<li><span>2x 63mm dirt discharge</span></li>\n<li><span>Connections on both sides</span></li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>The Eazy Pod Automatic is a self-cleaning, mechanical and biological filter system for garden ponds up to 10,000 litres.</p>\n<p>The integrated control box contains an adjustable timer which initiates a cleaning cycle automatically - meaning your filter will clean itself even when you’re not there!</p>\n<p>Inside the control box, the electronic connector blocks control the automated waste valve, along with your choice of circulating pump (not supplied).</p>\n<p>Crystal clear, healthy water is achieved by K1 Micro filter media, which also provides enhanced biological benefits by way of its protected surface area.</p>\n<p>The Eazy pod UV Automatic features an integrated 18 Watt UVC built in to the inlet section of the filter, helping to clear green water. </p>\n<p>How the Eazy Pod Automatic works.</p>\n<p>The concept of the Eazy Pod Automatic is simple and yet innovative. Water enters via the inlet and passes over an 18 watt UV Clarifying bulb helping to kill any single celled algae in the water. </p>\n<p>The water then enters the outer chamber, which runs around the entire circumference of the Eazy Pod. Between the outer chamber and the inner chamber, there is a stainless steel perforated screen. These perforations are situated in the lower half of the screen and around its entire face. This means that when the water passes from the outer to inner chamber, a downward and upward flow is created. This causes many of the larger solids to settle in the base of the outer chamber, due to the force of gravity.</p>\n<p>The size of the perforations will not allow large mechanical waste to enter the inner chamber, thus acting as a first stage mechanical filter. The inner chamber holds 18 litres of static K1 Micro media. As the water enters the inner chamber, the fine smaller solids become entrapped in the K1 Micro. After passing through the K1 Micro, the clean water then rises and overflows into the inner return pipe. From here it returns to the pond via the return outlet.</p>\n",

This is the first stage of mechanical filtration.</p>\n<p>As water enters the central chamber, through the stainless steel grill, the fine smaller solids become trapped in the mass of K1 Micro.

    "description_text": "\n<p>UltraSieve filters are the most reliable pre-filters on the market. This is partly due to the simple design, with just one moving part. The pre-filter is not self-cleaning, but it is very easy to maintain. Open the slide valve and the debris can be washed away. The UltraSieve pre-filters have a stainless steel filter element that never needs to be replaced. Thanks to the triangular stainless steel rods at a 7° angle, the water falls directly through the sieve, but the debris remains. A major advantage of this principle is that the debris is truly removed from the water circulation. This is highly beneficial to the water quality, because waste products are no longer polluting the water.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The most efficient pre-filter for (swimming) ponds</li>\n<li>Reliable!

    "description_text": "\n<p><span>Why AquaForte UltraBead filters?</span></p>\n<p><span>• Clear water (filtration down to 10 micron!)<br/>• Provides biologically healthy and clear water (plant filters are not necessary)<br/>• Compact (&lt; 1m²)<br/>• Easy to clean (clean hands)<br/>• Water is 100% recyclable<br/>• Low power consumption (through bypass and variable speed pumps)<br/>• Highest quality filter tank<br/>• Reliable!</span></p>\n<p><span>How it works:</span></p>\n<p><span>Bead filters are closed pressure vessels filled with millions of plastic beads. Because these beads float, they provide the mechanical filtration, and because of their large bonding surface they also provide biological filtration. Mechanical filtration: the beads float in a closed vessel and are therefore very close to each other. The water is pushed through them by the pressure of the pump, while the dirt particles become trapped among the beads. As the filter is used for a longer period of time, the biofilm around the beads becomes thicker and thicker, allowing increasingly fine dirt to be collected (down to 10 microns!). Biological filtration: the plastic beads have an adhesion surface area of about 1600 m²/m³. The biofilm layer on the beads therefore provides a huge amount of surface area for the bacteria to break down ammonium, nitrite and nitrate.<br/></span></p>\n<p><span>Technical specifications:<br/>• Filters are delivered incl. beads.<br/>• All models are standard equipped with the completely new valve construction with standard bypass.<br/>• The new UltraBead filters are made of indestructible thermoplastic with the world's most reliable injection moulding method with moulded base.<br/>• The UB140 is also fitted with Ø75 mm piping for even less resistance.<br/>• The fish population in the table is based on 1% feed per day.<br/>• Recommended pump capacity: The pump must be able to pump half of the actual pond volume per hour at 2-3 metres of water column (0.2-0.3 bar) (see pump chart of the pump concerned).<br/>• For koi ponds of 40m³ and larger, a flow rate of once every 3 to 4 hours is used.<br/>• Maximum working pressure 2.5 bar (25 metres).</span></p>\n<p><span>Download Manual <a data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/ultrabead_manual.pdf?v=1670495012\" href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/ultrabead_manual.pdf?v=1670495012\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Download UltraBead Manual\">HERE</a></span></p>\n",

A water level sensor detects whether sufficient water is still flowing through the drum. Should the drum sieve become too clogged, it is automatically rinsed. The trapped dirt is then removed from the sieve fully automatically by the high-pressure pump, and the dirt is transported to the sewers via the nozzles and a drainage channel. The water then flows through the biological section where an air stone has already been fitted to ensure proper aeration, all in the same compact casing.</p>\n<p>The SuperDrum can be buried entirely, and can be used with pump-fed applications. UV lamps can easily be fitted in the casing.</p>\n<p>All SuperDrums are supplied with a cover, rinsing pump and control electronics, but without UV and biological filtration equipment.</p>\n<h1>Technical Data</h1>\n<table class=\"data table additional-attributes\" id=\"product-attribute-specs-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Weight (kg)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Weight (kg)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Brand</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Brand\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Air-Aqua</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Manufacturer</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Manufacturer\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Air-Aqua BV</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Country of manufacture</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Country of manufacture\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Netherlands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Max. flow (m3/hour)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Max. flow (m3/hour)\" style=\"text-align: left;\">30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Advice max.

Because these beads float, they provide the mechanical filtration, and because of their large bonding surface they also provide biological filtration. Mechanical filtration: the beads float in a closed vessel and are therefore very close to each other. The water is pushed through them by the pressure of the pump, while the dirt particles become trapped among the beads. As the filter is used for a longer period of time, the biofilm around the beads becomes thicker and thicker, allowing increasingly fine dirt to be collected (down to 10 microns!). Biological filtration: the plastic beads have an adhesion surface area of about 1600 m²/m³. The biofilm layer on the beads therefore provides a huge amount of surface area for the bacteria to break down ammonium, nitrite and nitrate.<br/></span></p>\n<p><span> Technical specifications: <br/>• Filters are delivered incl. beads. <br/>• All models are standard equipped with the completely new valve construction with standard bypass. <br/>• The new UltraBead filters are made of indestructible thermoplastic with the world's most reliable injection moulding method with moulded base. <br/>• The UB140 is also fitted with Ø75 mm piping for even less resistance. <br/>• The fish population in the table is based on 1% feed per day. <br/>• Recommended pump capacity: The pump must be able to pump half of the actual pond volume per hour at 2-3 metres of water column (0.2-0.3 bar) (see pump chart of the pump concerned). <br/>• For koi ponds of 40m³ and larger, a flow rate of once every 3 to 4 hours is used. <br/>• Maximum working pressure 2.5 bar (25 metres).</span></p>\n<p><span>Download Manual <a data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/ultrabead_manual.pdf?v=1670495012\" href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/ultrabead_manual.pdf?v=1670495012\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Download UltraBead Manual\">HERE</a></span></p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>The concept of the EazyPod Automatic is simple and yet innovative. The water enters the outer chamber, which runs around the entire circumference of the EazyPod. Between the outer chamber and the inner chamber, there is a stainless steel perforated screen. These perforations are situated in the lower half of the screen and around its entire face. This means that when the water passes from the outer to inner chamber, a downward and upward flow is created. This causes many of the larger solids to settle in the base of the outer chamber, due to the force of gravity.</p>\n<p>The size of the perforations will not allow large mechanical waste to enter the inner chamber, thus acting as a first stage mechanical filter. The inner chamber holds 18 litres of static K1 Micro media. As the water enters the inner chamber, the fine smaller solids become entrapped in the K1 Micro. After passing through the K1 Micro, the clean water then rises and overflows into the inner return pipe. From here it returns to the pond via the return outlet. The EazyPod Automatic filtration system gives water quality and clarity that surpasses all expectations. The nature and volume of the K1 Micro means, that when static, apart from being a very efficient mechanical filter, there is more than enough surface area for beneficial bacteria to colonise. Therefore on a smaller pond, the EazyPod Automatic is an excellent complete filter.</p>\n",

Because these beads float, they provide the mechanical filtration, and because of their large bonding surface they also provide biological filtration. Mechanical filtration: the beads float in a closed vessel and are therefore very close to each other. The water is pushed through them by the pressure of the pump, while the dirt particles become trapped among the beads. As the filter is used for a longer period of time, the biofilm around the beads becomes thicker and thicker, allowing increasingly fine dirt to be collected (down to 10 microns!). Biological filtration: the plastic beads have an adhesion surface area of about 1600 m²/m³. The biofilm layer on the beads therefore provides a huge amount of surface area for the bacteria to break down ammonium, nitrite and nitrate.<br/></span></p>\n<p><span>Technical specifications:<br/>• Filters are delivered incl. beads.<br/>• All models are standard equipped with the completely new valve construction with standard bypass.<br/>• The new UltraBead filters are made of indestructible thermoplastic with the world's most reliable injection moulding method with moulded base.<br/>• The UB140 is also fitted with Ø75 mm piping for even less resistance.<br/>• The fish population in the table is based on 1% feed per day.<br/>• Recommended pump capacity: The pump must be able to pump half of the actual pond volume per hour at 2-3 metres of water column (0.2-0.3 bar) (see pump chart of the pump concerned).<br/>• For koi ponds of 40m³ and larger, a flow rate of once every 3 to 4 hours is used.<br/>• Maximum working pressure 2.5 bar (25 metres).</span></p>\n<p><span>Download Manual <a data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/ultrabead_manual.pdf?v=1670495012\" href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0002/5244/4700/files/ultrabead_manual.pdf?v=1670495012\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Download UltraBead Manual\">HERE</a></span></p>\n",

This exceptional mechanical and biological filter system ensures your aquatic haven thrives with crystal-clear water.</p>\n<p>Harnessing the power of 18 litres of static K1 Micro, the EazyPod delivers superior biological benefits, transforming into a powerhouse of cleanliness even when utilized solely as a mechanical waste filter. As water gracefully enters through the inlet, it embarks on a journey around the outer chamber. The stainless steel grill acts as a gatekeeper, swiftly filtering out larger solids that settle at the chamber's base – a meticulous dance in the realm of mechanical filtration.</p>\n<p>The second act unfolds as water ventures into the central chamber, navigating the stainless steel grill once more. Here, the finer particles find themselves ensnared in the embrace of the K1 Micro. Within each piece of this cutting-edge media, bio-films flourish on protected surfaces, paving the way for unparalleled biological filtration. The clean water, having undergone this transformative process, ascends and gracefully overflows into the inner return pipe, embarking on its journey back to the pond via the outlet.</p>\n<p>Cleaning the EazyPod is a breeze, thanks to its ingenious design. Employing the connected air pump during the cleaning cycle, the K1 Micro is stirred and rejuvenated, liberating any accumulated debris and waste. For optimal results, we recommend a 70-litre-per-minute air pump during the cleaning cycle – a touch of maintenance magic.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that only the EazyPodAir and EazyPod Complete models come complete with a 70-litre-per-minute air pump and accessory kit, ensuring you have all the tools at your fingertips for a seamless aquatic experience.

    "description_text": "\n<p>The concept of the EazyPod Automatic is simple and yet innovative. The water enters the outer chamber, which runs around the entire circumference of the EazyPod. Between the outer chamber and the inner chamber, there is a stainless steel perforated screen. These perforations are situated in the lower half of the screen and around its entire face. This means that when the water passes from the outer to inner chamber, a downward and upward flow is created. This causes many of the larger solids to settle in the base of the outer chamber, due to the force of gravity.</p>\n<p>The size of the perforations will not allow large mechanical waste to enter the inner chamber, thus acting as a first stage mechanical filter. The inner chamber holds 18 litres of static K1 Micro media. As the water enters the inner chamber, the fine smaller solids become entrapped in the K1 Micro. After passing through the K1 Micro, the clean water then rises and overflows into the inner return pipe. From here it returns to the pond via the return outlet. The EazyPod Automatic filtration system gives water quality and clarity that surpasses all expectations. The nature and volume of the K1 Micro means, that when static, apart from being a very efficient mechanical filter, there is more than enough surface area for beneficial bacteria to colonise. Therefore on a smaller pond, the EazyPod Automatic is an excellent complete filter.</p>\n",

They can be entirely dug in and can also be used in a pump-fed setup. UV lamps can easily be mounted in the casing. About 60% of the biological component is above the surface of the water, in an oxygen-rich environment (20% compared to a maximum of 4% oxygen in water). This ensures optimal oxygen saturation.The effect of a trickle filter is imitated without the need to pump water upwards.</p>\n<p>Where 100 litres of Hel-X in a moving bed can break down about 16 grams of food/day, a BioRotator breaks down about 80 grams/day*.</p>\n<p>An air pump is not required for this filter type, which significantly reduces the negative effect of dissolving nitrogen in water. Since the biological filter material is surrounded by far more oxygen, the filter ripens faster and more efficiently. This also makes fluctuations in feed intensity easier to handle. Ammonia and nitrite are removed more quickly and more effectively compared to filters with fully submerged filter material. After use of a BioRotator, the water is richer in oxygen. On top of that, it contains fewer anaerobic (harmful) bacteria. The BioRotator is a high-grade total solution for Koi and swimming ponds with a maximum flow of 50m3/hour.</p>\n<p>Method:</p>\n<p>The water flows into the drum sieve, where any dirt larger than 70 microns (0.07mm) is removed. A water level sensor measures whether enough water flows through the drum. If the drum sieve becomes overly clogged, an automatic flushing programme is activated. The collected dirt is automatically removed from the sieve by means of the high-pressure pump and transported to the sewer via nozzles and a flushing channel.</p>\n<p>For the Compact models, both the biological component and the drum filter continuously rotate: they are connected. The benefit of this is that only a single motor is required and that the entire surface of the drum filter can be used to collect dirt. Normally, only about half the surface is submerged and available for dirt collection. This results in a lower flushing frequency and reduced water consumption.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The BioRotator is a drum filter combined with a continuously rotating biological filter.The key properties at a glance:</p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">over 5x more waste substance breakdown by bacteria compared to so-called moving bed filters*</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">the biological component ripens faster</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">suitable for varying fish quantities/feed intensities</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">no energy loss due to the need to pump water upwards compared to a trickle filter</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">no air pump -&gt; less nitrogen is dissolved into the water</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The BioRotator Compact M comes with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lid</li>\n<li>control electronics</li>\n<li>Moving Bed Hel-X 17mm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Compact Medium uses 100 litres of Hel-X 17 as its biological filter material and can process about 35 m3/hour.</p>\n<p>A connection for the Super UV is available by default.</p>\n<p>The BioRotators are very energy efficient, have compact dimensions, are made of high-quality materials and are completely automated. They can be entirely dug in and can also be used in a pump-fed setup. UV lamps can easily be mounted in the casing. About 60% of the biological component is above the surface of the water, in an oxygen-rich environment (20% compared to a maximum of 4% oxygen in water). This ensures optimal oxygen saturation.The effect of a trickle filter is imitated without the need to pump water upwards.</p>\n<p>Where 100 litres of Hel-X in a moving bed can break down about 16 grams of food/day, a BioRotator breaks down about 80 grams/day*.</p>\n<p>An air pump is not required for this filter type, which significantly reduces the negative effect of dissolving nitrogen in water. Since the biological filter material is surrounded by far more oxygen, the filter ripens faster and more efficiently. This also makes fluctuations in feed intensity easier to handle. Ammonia and nitrite are removed more quickly and more effectively compared to filters with fully submerged filter material. After use of a BioRotator, the water is richer in oxygen. On top of that, it contains fewer anaerobic (harmful) bacteria. The BioRotator is a high-grade total solution for Koi and swimming ponds with a maximum flow of 50m3/hour.</p>\n<p>Method:</p>\n<p>The water flows into the drum sieve, where any dirt larger than 70 microns (0.07mm) is removed. A water level sensor measures whether enough water flows through the drum. If the drum sieve becomes overly clogged, an automatic flushing programme is activated. The collected dirt is automatically removed from the sieve by means of the high-pressure pump and transported to the sewer via nozzles and a flushing channel.</p>\n<p>For the Compact models, both the biological component and the drum filter continuously rotate: they are connected. The benefit of this is that only a single motor is required and that the entire surface of the drum filter can be used to collect dirt. Normally, only about half the surface is submerged and available for dirt collection. This results in a lower flushing frequency and reduced water consumption.</p>\n<h1> Technical Data</h1>\n<table class=\"data table additional-attributes\" id=\"product-attribute-specs-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Weight (kg)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Weight (kg)\">70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Max. flow (m3/hour)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Max. flow (m3/hour)\">30-45</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Inlet (mm)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Inlet (mm)\">4x110</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Outlet (mm)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Outlet (mm)\">4x110</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Dimensions (mm)</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Dimensions (mm)\">1450x840x786</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">EAN</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"EAN\">8717591054658</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Taric code</th>\n<td class=\"col data\" data-th=\"Taric code\">84212100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p> </p> <p>K1 Micro has been specifically designed for use in bead filters, conventional<br/>pond filters and aquarium filters. K1 Micro has the same wheel shaped design<br/>as K1 Media, but it has an increased protected surface area of 950 m^2 per m^3.<br/>The wheel shaped structure of Micro is designed specifically to create the most<br/>effective environment for the nitrification process to take place. As Micro media<br/>matures, bacteria colonises in the ‚‚¦quiet areas‚‚½ of each piece of media helping<br/>to improve nitrification / de-nitrification. This enables a well-balanced biological equilibrium to be sustained in your pond to<br/>keep fish healthy and the water crystal clear.</p> <p>The small size of K1 Micro makes it ideal to be used a replacement for beads in a bead filter. Not only will the vast 950m^2<br/>per m^3 protected surface area maintain a bio-film that helps to improve nitrification, water quality and clarity, but K1 Micro<br/>can offer many more benefits:<br/>*Increased protection for the bio-film- K1 Micro retains the bio-film within its wheel shaped structure.<br/>*Improved solids handling- A static bed of K1 Micro packs tightly together with areas for solid particles and fines to be<br/>captured, helping to reduce TDS levels.<br/>*Increased flow rate- K1 Micro allows enough water to flow evenly through media rather than tracking around a ‚‚¦clump‚‚½<br/>of beads. This means that flow rates are improved when using ‚‚¦like for like‚‚½ pumps.<br/>*Reduced back pressure- The improved flow also reduces the back pressure or resistance inflicted on the pump. In turn<br/>this improves the pumps‚‚¾‚ efficiency and may even result in the need for a lower rated pump which will ultimately save<br/>you money!<br/>*Improved cleaning- During a cleaning process, the bio-film remains protected within the K1 Micro.<br/>*Semi buoyant media- The Media is a semi buoyant media which makes it ideal for a bead filter.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p><strong>Introducing the Cetus Sieve: A Cutting-Edge Pre-Filter</strong></p>\n<p>Experience the pinnacle of pre-filtration technology with the Cetus Sieve, a revolutionary bow screen pre-filter crafted using state-of-the-art rotational molding techniques. Setting new standards in quality and performance, this remarkable device stands as the unrivaled leader in its field. Designed to tackle mechanical waste in ponds with unparalleled efficiency, it outshines traditional bow screen technology in every way.</p>\n<p>The Cetus Sieve is a versatile powerhouse that can be easily configured for either gravity-fed or pump-fed setups, boasting numerous advantages over its predecessors. Acting as a self-adjusting sieve, it offers you the flexibility to install it according to your specific needs. By effectively removing vast quantities of waste and debris before the water reaches your existing filtration system, it performs a crucial function known as \"pre-filtering.\"</p>\n<p>But the Cetus Sieve doesn't stop there—its capabilities extend even further. Acting as a standalone unit, it excels at clearing leaves and floating debris from your pond through its innovative surface skimmer. Leave no trace of unwanted materials in your pristine water.</p>\n<p>Compatible with all filtration systems, the Cetus Sieve truly shines as the perfect pre-filter companion for the Evolution Aqua Nexus filter range. For gravity-fed systems, its built-in weir automatically adapts to the flow rate of your pump, ensuring seamless operation. (Maximum flow rate: 18,000 liters/hr). Furthermore, when integrated before any other biological or mechanical filter, the Cetus Sieve significantly extends the time between cleanings. By eliminating organic matter that consumes oxygen and releases ammonia and other compounds into the water, it enhances the biological processes at work.</p>\n<p>Experience the next generation of pre-filtration with the Cetus Sieve—where innovation meets excellence, and your pond thrives in clarity and purity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Unveiling the Inner Workings of the Cetus Sieve</strong></p>\n<p>Effortless Installation</p>\n<p>When it comes to installing the Cetus Sieve, simplicity reigns supreme. Thanks to its innovative and patented Pondflow regulation system, this marvel of engineering offers a variable inlet height. This ingenious feature proves invaluable for gravity-fed setups, allowing the water levels within your pond to decrease without depriving the circulating pump of its vital water supply. With the Cetus Sieve, your skimmer or bottom drain can effortlessly handle copious amounts of waste, significantly reducing the need for frequent and extensive cleaning.</p>\n<p>Operating Principles</p>\n<p>Depending on your setup, the Cetus Sieve can be used in two different configurations. For pump-fed systems, the sieve is positioned above the water level of your pond, with the exit water gracefully descending through gravity into your primary filter. On the other hand, if you opt for gravity-fed operation, the Cetus Sieve takes its place at a level below the water surface. From there, the water is pumped to either a conventional filter positioned above the pond (such as the Nexus Eazy or Eazy Pod) or a pressurized filter.</p>\n<p>Versatile Pre-Filtration</p>\n<p>The Cetus Sieve, with its bow screen design, stands as an ideal pre-filter for any biological filtration system, including pressurized filters. It is highly recommended to incorporate the Cetus Sieve into your setup when utilizing pressurized filters to minimize the need for frequent backwashing and maintenance caused by heavy solids. By harnessing the pre-filtering capabilities of the Cetus Sieve, you can achieve optimal performance and longevity for your filtration system, while enjoying reduced upkeep.</p>\n<p>With the Cetus Sieve, installation is a breeze, and its versatile functionality empowers your filtration system to operate at its best, handling waste with ease and efficiency. Embrace the power of pre-filtration and unlock a world of hassle-free pond maintenance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Effortless Installation of the Cetus Sieve</strong><br/><br/>With the Cetus Sieve, installation is a breeze, thanks to its innovative features and intelligent design. Equipped with the unique patented Pondflow regulation system, this remarkable device offers a variable inlet height specifically designed for gravity-fed setups. This ingenious system ensures that water levels within your pond can naturally decrease without starving the circulating pump of the vital water it needs to operate flawlessly. By implementing the Cetus Sieve, you create an environment where skimmers and bottom drains can effortlessly handle substantial amounts of waste, greatly reducing the need for frequent and laborious cleaning.<br/><br/>In a gravity-fed system, the water, after passing through the Cetus Sieve, needs to be pumped to a standard filter positioned above the pond level, such as the Nexus Eazy or Eazy Pod. Alternatively, it can be directed to a pressurized filter for optimal filtration performance.<br/><br/>For pump-fed systems, the Cetus Sieve is positioned above the water level of your pond, allowing the exit water to gracefully cascade into your main filter through the power of gravity. This innovative configuration ensures seamless water flow and efficient pre-filtration.<br/><br/>The Cetus Sieve, with its bow screen pre-filter design, is perfectly suited for pre-filtration in any biological filtration system, including pressurized filters. It is highly recommended to incorporate the Cetus Sieve into your setup when utilizing pressurized filters to minimize the need for excessive backwashing and maintenance caused by heavy solids. By introducing the Cetus Sieve as a pre-filter, you enhance the longevity and performance of your entire filtration system.<br/><br/>Enjoy the simplicity and effectiveness of installing the Cetus Sieve, and let it revolutionize the way you maintain and optimize your pond's water quality.</p>\n<table data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<tbody data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<tr data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Model</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Max. flow rate</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Inlet - Gravity Fed</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Inlet - Pump Fed</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Outlet - Gravity Fed</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Outlet - Pump Fed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><img alt=\"Cetus\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-src=\"https://evolutionaqua.com/pub/media/pagebuilder/Banners-Blocks/Cetus-Logo-thumb.png\" height=\"53\" src=\"https://evolutionaqua.com/pub/media/pagebuilder/Banners-Blocks/Cetus-Logo-thumb.png\" width=\"200\"/></td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">18,000 Litres/hr<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>4,000 UK Gallons/hr<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>4,755 US Gallons/hr</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">110mm/4\"</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">50mm/1½\"</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">1½\"</td>\n<td data-mce-fragment=\"1\">3\"</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

This results in K+Media maturing much faster than many other types of media. The minerals create a rough surface on the media, featuring a microscopic honeycomb of peaks and craters that allow waste particles to collect and nitrifying bacteria to thrive. Serving as a food source, the minerals promote the development and multiplication of bacteria, thus improving development times. Calcium has proven advantages for establishing and maintaining effective biofilms. Enzymes are also added to enhance the media's adhesive properties, facilitating the adherence of waste particles. Salt, added during production, dissolves during cooling, leaving a rough surface ideal for biofilm adhesion.</p>\n<p>With its new shape and profile, K+Media boasts an unparalleled surface area, providing an overall surface area of 1,350m² per m³. Importantly for biological filtration, the protected surface area of K+Media is 1,025m² per m³. This allows for the formation and preservation of a stable biofilm, particularly beneficial in moving bed biological filtration systems.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p> </p> <p><strong>Why do i need</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2 brushes, each 59\" x 5.5\" (1500mm x 140mm) diameter.</strong><span> If you have mature koi of each gender, they will be ready to spawn at any time from April to August.  The earliest they will spawn is temperature and daylight dependent and so a warm spring will bring the season forward and cold weather will delay it.  Koi look for somewhere suitable to lay their eggs.  In nature this will be plants, roots and filamentous algae.  Since most domestic koi ponds are devoid or short of these, either the koi will not spawn at all or they will try to spawn on the walls of the pond.  The very act of spawning is extremely energetic and so the fish are at risk of damaging themselves on the hard edges of the pond if they have nothing more suitable on which to spawn. Spawning brushes are ideal particularly when breeding your koi have no natural plant life to spawn on. Our koi spawning brushes are particularly important for ponds that do not have water hyacinths and other plant life that are essential to your koi‚‚¾‚s reproduction. Each Black Knight spawning brush is approximately 59 inches (159cm) long with a diameter of 5.5 inches (14cm). They are lighter, more compact alternatives to koi spawning mats and mops. Unlike other spawning products, our koi spawning brushes are extremely easy to use. Black Knight spawning brushes are designed to be harmless to the fish (they are soft and smooth) and to emulate plants.  Simply placing the brushes appropriately in the pond will provide a focal point for the fish that is out of harm‚‚¾‚s way and will dramatically reduce the chances that the fish will injure themselves on the side of the pond.  </span></p>\n<p><strong>How do they work</strong></p>\n<p><span>Our spawning brushes need no preparation before use.  They can be suspended on the pond in the most suitable position to encourage the fish to spawn on them. When the mature female is ready, she will give off pheromones which will trigger activity amongst the males.  You will probably first notice something happening during the evening.  Perhaps two to four males will start showing a greater interest in the female and will start following her more closely.  This will be relatively low-key activity for several hours. Koi always start spawning early in the morning and the process can take several hours.  It starts with an escalation in activity and the males will be harrying the female and almost pushing her around.  As soon as she is ready, she will be ready to release her eggs and the process will begin. Cyprinids (members of the carp family) do not lay their eggs all in one go and in one place.  The female will shoot forwards at high speed across the spawning brushes and squirt a few eggs each time onto them.  The eggs are coated in a sticky substance that makes the eggs adhere to the brushes.  During each bombing run (when you see it, you will understand why we are describing it in this way), the males will follow immediately behind the female and will spray their milt over the eggs to fertilise them.  This process will be repeated many times.  A small female may do it 40 times and a very large one may do it 150 times. The eggs will remain stuck to the brushes although you may not be able to see them.  You can lift the brushes out of the water briefly to have a look.  They are translucent and look like tiny spheres of jelly. You can leave the brushes in the pond if you wish for incubation and hatching.  If you want to maximize the number of fry that hatch then it is better to remove the brushes to another oxygenated and filtered tank or pond away from the other fish.  Mature fish will eat many eggs and fry if you let nature take its course in the pond. If you wish to move the fish, ensure that you equalize water temperatures first because a temperature shock will reduce the success rate. Fertilised eggs will show a couple of black spots (the eyes) after two or three days.  All unviable eggs will turn white in a day or two.  The dead eggs will attract fungus which can be minimized by adding some malachite green to the water. In high temperatures, the eggs can hatch in about 3 ½ days and in up to 8 days in cool temperatures.  Typically, a period around 5 days is average and this should be achieved at around 18 ‚‚ 21 deg C.  The fry will hatch and then stick to any nearby object and wait there for a further day while they digest the remainder of their yolk sac.  When the yolk runs out they will swim to the surface to take a gulp of air to inflate their swimbladder for the first time.  From this point on they are free swimming and will be looking for food. A few hours after the fry start to hatch, you should remove the brushes so that the remaining dead eggs do not pollute the water. Koi fry can be difficult to feed artificially for the first two weeks.  In nature they would feed on zooplankton.  These are tiny animals that live in suspension in the water (such as daphnia) and are an ideal first meal for the fry.  You can make your own zooplankton by hatching brine shrimp.  You can buy freeze-dried brine shrimp eggs; you place them in oxygenated warm salt water and they hatch in 1 day.  It is quite a simple process and is ideal for feeding the small fry. You can buy dry fry food from your local aquarist.  This is fine for fry that are a week old but it is a little tricky to get newly hatched fry to start on it. One very important point is to monitor the water quality of your hatching tanks. It is essential that you have good mechanical and biological filtration if you are to raise your young fish successfully.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How to use</strong></p>\n<div class=\"col-lg-9 col-lg-push-3\">\n<div class=\"post-8 product type-product status-publish has-post-thumbnail product_cat-uncategorized first instock shipping-taxable purchasable product-type-variable has-default-attributes\" id=\"product-8\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Product\">\n<div class=\"bk-product-tabs-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"bg-tab-panel content-column\" id=\"how_to_use\">\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\"><span>Place the brushes below the water level, one above the other slightly away from the edge of the pond.  You can secure them in position by tying strings to the loops at the ends of the brushes.

    "description_text": "\n<p>New advanced filtration media</p>\n<p>After extensive research, a new media has been developed to address this issue while providing class-leading surface area for enhanced biological and mechanical filtration.</p>\n<p>During production, K+Media is infused with minerals and enzymes, resulting in a filtration media that outperforms competitors by offering a large protected surface area while significantly reducing the time required for biofilm establishment.</p>\n<p>During production, a variety of minerals, including magnesium, calcium, enzymes, and salt, are mixed into the raw material for K+Media manufacturing. This results in K+Media maturing much faster than many other types of media. The minerals create a rough surface on the media, featuring a microscopic honeycomb of peaks and craters that allow waste particles to collect and nitrifying bacteria to thrive. Serving as a food source, the minerals promote the development and multiplication of bacteria, thus improving development times. Calcium has proven advantages for establishing and maintaining effective biofilms. Enzymes are also added to enhance the media's adhesive properties, facilitating the adherence of waste particles. Salt, added during production, dissolves during cooling, leaving a rough surface ideal for biofilm adhesion.</p>\n<p>With its new shape and profile, K+Media boasts an unparalleled surface area, providing an overall surface area of 1,350m² per m³. Importantly for biological filtration, the protected surface area of K+Media is 1,025m² per m³. This allows for the formation and preservation of a stable biofilm, particularly beneficial in moving bed biological filtration systems.</p>\n",

Generally the water should flow into the chamber at slow speed rather than being jetted in under pressure. Water travelling at high speed not only causes turbulence, which will disturb settled material, but it can also wash off some of the waste which has been trapped successfully in the brushes.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use</strong></p>\n<div class=\"col-lg-9 col-lg-push-3\">\n<div class=\"post-8 product type-product status-publish has-post-thumbnail product_cat-uncategorized first instock shipping-taxable purchasable product-type-variable has-default-attributes\" id=\"product-8\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Product\">\n<div class=\"bk-product-tabs-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"bg-tab-panel content-column\" id=\"how_to_use\">\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\">Before purchasing Black Knight brushes, you should decide what type of filter design will be best for your pond.<span> </span><strong>How to use Black Knight Filter Brushes</strong><span> </span>If you have a small pond with a few goldfish and a couple of koi then a single chamber with three to six lines of brushes will be ideal. For a more demanding situation, it will be necessary to use a much larger chamber or to link two or three together. These can all contain brushes or you can use them in the first and second chambers and then use a stone medium such  Alfagrog in the last chamber.</div>\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\">\n<strong>Maintenance</strong><br/>\n<div class=\"col-lg-9 col-lg-push-3\">\n<div class=\"post-8 product type-product status-publish has-post-thumbnail product_cat-uncategorized first instock shipping-taxable purchasable product-type-variable has-default-attributes\" id=\"product-8\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Product\">\n<div class=\"bk-product-tabs-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"bg-tab-panel content-column\" id=\"maintenance\">\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\">When a significant amount of waste has built up on the brushes, it should be flushed away.

    "description_text": "\n<p>Plastic media pioneered in biological pond filters, particularly in moving bed bio reactors, two decades ago, brought about a significant shift in filtration technology. However, a persistent issue has been the lengthy time required to establish a stable biofilm crucial for filtration effectiveness.</p>\n<p>The K+ Sinking Filter Media, manufactured in the UK, boasts an innovative design with unmatched surface area for enhanced biological and mechanical filtration. Through precise extrusion, integrate minerals, enzymes, and additives into the raw material, resulting in a media that surpasses competitors by providing a large protected surface area while significantly reducing maturation times.</p>\n<p>During production, a range of minerals including magnesium, calcium, enzymes, and salt are meticulously infused into the raw material used for K+Media. This process creates a rough surface on the media, ideal for waste particle collection and nitrifying bacteria colonization. The minerals serve as a vital food source, accelerating bacteria development and multiplication. Additionally, enzymes enhance the media's adhesive properties, aiding waste particle adherence, while salt promotes biofilm formation.</p>\n<p>With its new shape and profile, the K+ Sinking Filter Media offers an unparalleled surface area, crucial for stable biofilm formation. This ensures optimal biological filtration, particularly in moving bed biological filtration systems.</p>\n<p>The unique shape of K+ Sinking Filter Media maximizes quiet zones, facilitating stable biofilm development. This feature, coupled with an additional layer of cells and fins, enables microscopic organisms, distinguishing our media from competitors.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, our new filtration media addresses the challenges of traditional plastic media, offering accelerated maturation times and superior biological filtration, making it a game-changer in pond filtration technology.</p>\n",

Have you noticed that even though you get a lot of waste in the bottom of your vortex, you still find that the subsequent chambers get very dirty too. This is the very fine particles that do not have time to settle in the vortex and so they get drawn through the transfer port into the next chamber. </span></p>\n<p><strong>How do they work</strong></p>\n<p><span>Black Knight brushes work in three ways. First, they physically trap the large particles that cannot pass through the close weave of the interlocking filaments. Secondly, the filaments have a static charge that ‚‚¹grabs‚‚¾‚ any small particles that are flowing by. This charge holds onto the waste until you do your routine cleaning. Thirdly, after you have been using the brushes for a few weeks, the massive surface area of the brushes becomes home to millions of beneficial nitrifying bacteria that will help to purify your water biologically.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How to use</strong></p>\n<div class=\"col-lg-9 col-lg-push-3\">\n<div class=\"post-8 product type-product status-publish has-post-thumbnail product_cat-uncategorized first instock shipping-taxable purchasable product-type-variable has-default-attributes\" id=\"product-8\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Product\">\n<div class=\"bk-product-tabs-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"bg-tab-panel content-column\" id=\"how_to_use\">\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\"><span>Simply insert a vortex brush in the path of the flowing water and you will be amazed at how much waste is collected in a short time. If your second and subsequent chambers are already full of media then you can use either one vortex brush strategically placed around the transfer port or you can use several to build up a barrier of them above the inlet of the vortex and below the outlet (assuming that your vortex is designed in this way). This will allow the heavy waste to drop to the bottom of the chamber and then all the waste that does not settle is forced to pass through the brushes thus allowing it to be caught. You can coil one or two vortex brushes around the outlet so that the water has to pass through the brushes. You can create a complete barrier filling the whole cross section of the chamber. The more brushes you use, the greater the amount of waste that can be collected and also the larger the surface area for biological filtration Vortex brushes can be used in as many chambers as you wish. It is a good idea to leave some room in the first chamber to allow for settlement but subsequent chambers can be filled with vortex or filter brushes as shown.</span></div>\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\">\n<strong>Maintenance</strong><br/>\n<div class=\"col-lg-9 col-lg-push-3\">\n<div class=\"post-8 product type-product status-publish has-post-thumbnail product_cat-uncategorized first instock shipping-taxable purchasable product-type-variable has-default-attributes\" id=\"product-8\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Product\">\n<div class=\"bk-product-tabs-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"bg-tab-panel content-column\" id=\"maintenance\">\n<div class=\"content-column-inner content-clear\"><span>The frequency of cleaning will depend upon the size of the filter relative to the pond size and also the loading on the system i.e. the bodyweight of fish in the pond, how much they are eating and how much dust and plant debris is being produced. The rule of thumb is - the more often you do your cleaning, the cleaner your pond will be. On a lightly loaded system then once every three weeks in the warm months may be sufficient but twice a week may be necessary on a heavily loaded system. Brushes can be cleaned in-situ if you wish. Simply drain the chamber and then rinse the brushes by pouring buckets of pond water over them. Alternatively, you can take the brushes out, clean and then replace them. You can use chlorinated tapwater for cleaning them but you will temporarily reduce the biological effectiveness of the brushes with this method.</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-3 col-lg-pull-9\">\n<div class=\"sidebar changed-element\">\n<div class=\"widget widget_bk_get_in_touch widget-working-hours\" id=\"bk_get_in_touch-3\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

These microorganisms ensure that the degradation products in the pond are converted into harmless substances (nitrification). This is especially true for the two blue filter sponges included. The two red filter sponges, on the other hand, show their strengths with fine filtration properties and thus remove the smallest dirt particle residues from the water at a slow flow rate.

    "description_text": "\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Back on the road! Renewed model with ball valve for flow control and special new biorings for even better mix of oxygen. Thanks to the ball valve it is much easier to adjust the correct water level. Through a 4mm air connection and supplied flowmeter an air pump continuously pumps 0,5l/m (30l/h) air into the filter. This pressure ensures that the foam is pushed out of the filter through the foam outlet tube. The protein skimmer is a combination of a biological, mechanical and chemical filter. </span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The principle works as follows: the surface of an air bubble attracts substances dissolved in water. Due to the attraction of air bubbles, chemicals, dirt particles, dyes and algae are concentrated. Air is mixed with water by means of an air pump. By forcing this mixture through the filter material (biorings) to a lower outlet, a very long contact time between water and air is created. This changes the surface tension of the water continuously and creates a firm foam. This foam is separated from the purified water by a perforated cone and discharged. Substances dissolved in the water such as phosphates, ammonia, Humic acids, dyes, proteins and a number of heavy metals are filtered out of the water and discharged by means of the foam. </span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Water inlet: 25mm, water outlet: 40mm, foam outlet: 25mm.</span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Click <a href=\"https://webshop.sibo.nl/media/catalog/product/attachment/attachments/HL_SB926_Tornado_III_Manual_NDEF_v2105.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AquaForte Tornado III Protein Skimmer\">HERE</a> to view manual.</span></p>\n",

The water passing this filter mesh bag will be pumped out with the 900 watt dirty water submersible pump to waste or to a finer filter (like a sieve filter, drumfilter, fleece filter or other) when water loss is not desirable. The waste hose is fitted with a professional (fibreglass reinforced) Storz coupling.

    "description_text": "\n<p><span>New pond vacuum for pond maintenance without delay! Equipped with an internal dirty water submersible pump that continuously discharges the suctioned water. The suctioned water is first passed through a closable pre-filter bag so that leaves, algae, twigs, stones, substrate, etc. are captured. This very easily removable bag is easily opened with a coarse-toothed zipper for cleaning. The water passing through the filter bag is discharged to the sewer by the internal dirty water submersible pump or pumped to a finer filter (e.g. a sieve filter, drum filter or fleece filter) when water loss is not desirable. Standard 32 or 38mm poolflex hose can be used as waste hose! This makes it very easy and affordable to work with self-determined lengths of waste hose! The 1200 watt powerful suction turbine allows suction to a depth of 2.5 meters. The submersible pump has a separate plug so the suction can also be used only for dry vacuuming without discharging the water. Tank volume: 35 liters. Cable length: 4 meters. Supplied including: 3 suction attachments, 4 m suction hose, 4 suction tubes (2 transparent, 2 black) of 50 cm each, and 1.2 m waste hose. </span></p>\n",

With this powerful spotlight system, you can turn your garden into a stage: high-quality LEDs, which shine for up to 50,000 hours, set the scene for bodies of water or plants permanently and energy-efficiently with just 15 watts. The large spotlight floods individual garden areas with light or sets effective accents, especially on water fountains and trees. 1,250 lumens make the spotlight one of the brightest in the range. A colour temperature of 3,000 Kelvin provides warm light colours that create an atmospheric glow even from water depths of up to 4 m. Robust underwater connection technology and safe 24-volt DC low voltage make such applications \"with depth\" permanently watertight. So opt for this flexible and expandable system that always gives you the choice: it can be installed above or under water and can be used to realise individual lighting ideas with a 15° beam angle.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>INDIVIDUAL: Available in four different beam angles (narrow spot, spot, flood, wide flood)<br/>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>COLOUR TONES: A colour temperature of 3000 Kelvin is well suited to showcasing red objects; lights with 4000 Kelvin are particularly suitable for emphasising green tones (bamboo, hedges, etc.)<br/>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DURABLE: The excellent thermal management and the high LED quality enable a service life of more than 50,000 hours<br/>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>INCLUDED: 1 spotlight with 5 m cable and 1 peg<br/>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING?: Accessories required for an immediate start: LunAqua Power LED Driver with connection possibilities for up to four spotlights (2x LunAqua Power LED XL or 1x LunAqua Power LED XL and 2x LunAqua Power LED or 4x LunAqua Power LED)<br/>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>ROBUST: Spotlights, drivers and cables can be safely used in water up to 4 m deep (in accordance with standards, it is not possible to use the driver underwater in swimming ponds)<br/>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>SAFE: Also suitable for use in swimming ponds thanks to its low voltage (24 V DC)</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"pim-technical-data-table table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Dimensions (L x W x H)</td>\n<td>mm</td>\n<td>145 x 160 x 182</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rated voltage</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>24 V DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lamp power consumption</td>\n<td>W</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Energy efficiency class light fixture</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>F</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weighted energy consumption per lamp</td>\n<td>kWh/1000h</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Protection class</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>IP68</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cable length 24 V device</td>\n<td>m</td>\n<td>5.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net weight</td>\n<td>kg</td>\n<td>2.10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Limited Warranty</td>\n<td>Years</td>\n<td>2 + 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OASE Control connection</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bulb type</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>LED</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of individual LEDs</td>\n<td>Units</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Luminous flux</td>\n<td>lm</td>\n<td>1250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light color</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Warm-white</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colour temperature</td>\n<td>K</td>\n<td>3000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Beam angle</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>15 Degrees</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

The partially submerged water level sensor will inform the controller once a fluctuation in water depth drops below 20mm (3/4\"), sending a signal to open the supplied solenoid valve, allowing mains water to flood in to the pond or reservoir. Once the sensor detects that the correct water level has been achieved, the controller will switch the solenoid valve off.<br/><br/> The ProfiClear Guard is particularly useful in Koi Ponds or fish ponds with gravity<br/> fed filter systems as the water level is maintained consistently, regardless of evaporation. Commercial fountain displays which use water level dependent nozzles will also benefit from the top-up system to ensure the correct decorative water display is achieved consistently.<br/><br/> The OASE ProfiClear Guard Set includes:<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weatherproof Control Unit with power.</li>\n<li>Valve open and valve closed indicators.</li>\n<li>12 volt water level sensor with 20mm switching differential.</li>\n<li>Water mains operated, 230 volt Solenoid Valve, supplied with 2m cable.</li>\n<li>Solenoid Valve inlet and outlet are 1/2‚‚½ BSP female threaded.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><span class=\"property-label\">Technical Data</span></h1>\n<div class=\"property-value\">\n<table class=\"pim-technical-data-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Dimensions (L x W x H)</td>\n<td>mm</td>\n<td>120 x 55 x 111</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rated voltage</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>230 V / 50/60 Hz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rated voltage - sensor</td>\n<td>V</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Power consumption</td>\n<td>W</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net weight</td>\n<td>kg</td>\n<td>2.82</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Power cable length</td>\n<td>m</td>\n<td>2.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sensor cable length</td>\n<td>m</td>\n<td>20.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cable length of the valve</td>\n<td>m</td>\n<td>3.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td>mm</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>½\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max. operating pressure</td>\n<td>bar</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Switching differential</td>\n<td>mm</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Limited Warranty</td>\n<td>Years</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Protection class</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>IP 65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Length</td>\n<td>mm</td>\n<td>120</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n",

Yamitsu Algae Master Pond UV can be added to any existing filtration system. For best results algae master units should be fitted in line, after the pump, with<br/>water being forced through them. Use the largest size of pipe possible. If hosetails are to be used, it is very important that they are trimmed to the largest possible size that will fit inside the flexible pipe (before glueing in place). This will ensure that the maximum flow rate can be obtained for the size of pipe.</p>\n",

They offer 100% protection against eye damage, are particularly energy efficient thanks to an electronic ballast and are exceptionally effective in disinfection thanks to the long dwell time of the water in the Bitron. The flow-optimized reactor design ensures direct and almost loss-free UV radiation. A Bitron Premium can be connected very flexibly before or after the ProfiClear filter system - i.e. also in other gravity applications. If the pond or fish population increases, additional Bitron Premium UVC devices can be added at any time, and they can also be installed horizontally or vertically.

Average lifespan of the ballast is ± 5 years. The T5 lamp provides a radiation value of 25,000 microwatts. Working pressure maximum 2 bar. Keeps bacteria and algae under control</span></p>\n",

As the proteins<br/>\nare directly removed from the water column, the filter system will<br/>\nhave a significantly lighter job to do. The biological load of the<br/>\nwater will be lower, besides the fact that the air bubbles will<br/>\nincrease the oxygen level of the water. This will aid both fish<br/>\ngrowth as well as water clarity. The recommended flow is based<br/>\non a contact time of at least 1 minute which makes the Fresh-Skim<br/>\nalso qualified as a safe ozone reactor. When ozone is used we<br/>\nrecommend the use of a residual ozone destroyer for the air outlet<br/>\nto prevent the release of ozone in the air.<br/>\nThere are 2 options for mounting the redox electrode into the pipe<br/>\nsystem: in between the pump and the skimmer (before the ozone<br/>\ndosing), or in the return pipe from the skimmer (after the ozone<br/>\ndosing), or better, using both. Bigger skimmers are available on<br/>\ndemand. The ceramic air diffusers should be replaced yearly to<br/>\nmaintain maximum efficiency. The skimmer should be fed with<br/>\npre-filtered water (i.e. after a sieve- or drum filter)<br/>\nand the water should return to the pond freely by<br/>\ngravity, without any head pressure.<br/>\nProduct</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p> </p> <p>The Fresh-Skim protein skimmer, is an extremely efficient fresh<br/>\nwater protein skimmer due to their large volume. As the proteins<br/>\nare directly removed from the water column, the filter system will<br/>\nhave a significantly lighter job to do. The biological load of the<br/>\nwater will be lower, besides the fact that the air bubbles will<br/>\nincrease the oxygen level of the water. This will aid both fish<br/>\ngrowth as well as water clarity. The recommended flow is based<br/>\non a contact time of at least 1 minute which makes the Fresh-Skim<br/>\nalso qualified as a safe ozone reactor. When ozone is used we<br/>\nrecommend the use of a residual ozone destroyer for the air outlet<br/>\nto prevent the release of ozone in the air.<br/>\nThere are 2 options for mounting the redox electrode into the pipe<br/>\nsystem: in between the pump and the skimmer (before the ozone<br/>\ndosing), or in the return pipe from the skimmer (after the ozone<br/>\ndosing), or better, using both. Bigger skimmers are available on<br/>\ndemand. The ceramic air diffusers should be replaced yearly to<br/>\nmaintain maximum efficiency. The skimmer should be fed with<br/>\npre-filtered water (i.e. after a sieve- or drum filter)<br/>\nand the water should return to the pond freely by<br/>\ngravity, without any head pressure.<br/>\nProduct</p>\n",

They need easily digestible proteins to grow. They also need vitamins and minerals to develop a good body and bone structure.<br/>Balanced, health-supporting and immunity-boosting ingredients are also required. Kiyomizu Junior provides exactly what young Koi need.</span></p>\n<p>The Koi hobby is in continuous development thanks to improved knowledge about feed, water quality and pond design. Over the past few decades, many types of Koi feed have been <span>developed, including special food for growth &amp; extra growth, colour, health &amp; probiotics, winter (wheat germ) etc.<br/></span><br/><span>It is usual for lots of domestic animals such as puppies and kittens to be given special food. </span><span>As animals grow into adults and later in life, when they grow older, their nutritional requirements change. Each stage of life requires a different kind of food to ensure good health and a vital old age. This is no different with Koi.</span><br/><span>For this reason, Kiyomizu Koi Food offers a choice of three balanced formulas that provide Koi with exactly what they need at every stage of their lives. Or, perhaps even more importantly, they are prevented from getting too much of the nutrients that do more harm than good at certain stages of their lives.<br/></span><br/><span>Feeding Koi according to their age-related needs also optimises the water quality. Although good quality feed is extremely important, water quality is equally important to health and growth.<br/></span><br/><span>Kiyomizu Koi Food contains special ingredients that promote optimum digestion and absorption of vital </span><span>nutrients. The composition of Kiyomizu Koi Food helps maintain water quality and reduce organic waste.<br/></span><br/><span>In developing Kiyomizu Koi Food, the product was built from scratch around this concept using our existing knowledge of Koi and the best ingredients currently available to provide Koi with exactly the right blend required at their age. The latest and most innovative developments have been deployed in the manufacture of our feed, resulting in this new standard in Koi nutrition.<br/></span><br/><span>Kiyomizu Koi Food consists of:</span><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>BIO-MOS (mannan oligosaccharides)</span></li>\n<li><span>organic trace elements</span></li>\n<li><span>astaxanthin</span></li>\n<li><span>easily digestible protein</span></li>\n<li><span>prebiotics and probiotics</span></li>\n<li><span>organically bonded vitamins and minerals</span></li>\n<li><span>special algae products - essential for the production of Omega 3</span></li>\n<li><span>Montmorillonite clay (bentonite)</span></li>\n<li><span>yeast extracts</span></li>\n<li><span>ingredients to improve digestion</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/><span>The size of Kiyomizu Koi Food pellets is designed to suit the \"target audience\"‚. If the pond</span><br/><span>contains Koi of different sizes, we </span><span>recommend starting with the largest </span><span>pellets and waiting until the bigger Koi have started feeding before introducing the smaller pellets.</span><br/><span>Feed once to three times a day.<br/></span><br/><span>Do not feed the fish more than they eat in five minutes. Remove any uneaten feed.</span><br/><span>When the water temperature is less than 10ºC, Koi have a reduced appetite and slow digestion and should be fed </span><span>accordingly.<br/></span><br/><span>Do not feed Koi if the water </span><span>temperature drops below 5ºC.</span></p>\n",

This makes for optimal growth and a more beautiful colour pattern for fish such as koi. Smaller quantities of food are dispensed per feed, which is healthier for the fish and better for the pond. When the fish eat all the food there is no unnecessary pollution of the water and the filter is less likely to become clogged.</p>\n<p>With the easy-to-program timer the fish can be fed 1 to 24 times a day fully automatically. You can set the quantity of food by setting the required number of dispensing seconds per feeding from 0 to 600 seconds.

This kit is designed to give you a pretty good chance of repairing the damage. Before I go on to describe the treatment plan, one or two questions you must ask yourself; is this an isolated ‚‚¦one off‚‚½ wound or ulcer? Do other fish show signs of ulcers? If so please, please, please, be quite sure your water quality is good. Most ulcers that ‚‚¦break out‚‚½ on Koi and goldfish, (that have been previously o.k.) are normally a result of an underlying water quality issue. Poor water quality will only delay any healing process, especially if Ammonia is high.</p>\n<p>The secret to successful treatment is to catch the problem early and do something about it. Only in exceptional circumstances will a fish have the ability to heal without treatment. Also a certain amount of persistence is required. It is quite common for the need to repeat the treatment. This topical treatment kit can be used at any temperature any time of the year, though it must be pointed out the fish will heal quicker if the water temperature is 70°F + (21°C +). Do not be put off if you cannot achieve that temperature at the time of treatment, keeping the wound clean and free of bacteria at any temperature is very beneficial.</p>\n<p>The main problem faced when trying to heal a wound etc, is the ever present pathogenic bacteria in the pond and on the wound itself. It is beneficial to lower bacterial levels in the pond at the time of treatment, especially when the water is above 65°F (18°C) this can be achieved by adding Chloramine T or Acriflavine to the pond, or through non chemical beneficial products like Kusuri Pro-100 will not damage water quality or lower filter activity.</p>\n<p>Stage one:</p>\n<p>Prepare everything before you start! Firstly read through these instructions. If the wound is in an awkward location and the fish is above 6 inches, then it maybe best to sedate the fish. To sedate a fish take a bowl / plastic bag and add pond water just enough to cover the fish. Work out the volume of water that has been put in the bowl, and then add Masuzai Koi Sedate, at the rate of 10 mls to 2 gallons. Shake the bottle well before use. Agitate water to mix solution fully. Put fish in bowl and watch carefully, when the fish has \"gone over\" or can be lifted above the water for 20 seconds without \"kicking or twisting\" the fish is ready for treatment.</p>\n<p>Depending on fish size, temperature, general health, and gill efficiency it maybe necessary to add more Masuzai, add at the same rate to the same solution if the fish is not fully sedated after 2 minutes. This is common do not panic!</p>\n<p>Remember at any stage during treatment return the fish to the pond if you are in anyway concerned that all is not going well! Then follow stage 3.</p>\n<p>Soak a tea towel or similar with pond water. When the fish is sedated, place on the damp tea towel and cover the fish so only the treatment area is visible.</p>\n<p>Stage two:</p>\n<p>Dry wound area with a swab or cotton bud. If there are any very loose or dead scales remove them. Add Roccal Wound Cleaner on to the wound site to clean the treatment area, using a cotton bud. Dry off again. Avoid contact with eyes and gills. Wipe area clean and apply the penetrating Anti Bac solution on the wound (DO NOT DRY OFF). Then immediately sprinkle Orahesive Powder liberally on to treatment area, blow off excess powder. Allow powder to absorb into the wound (about 20-30 seconds). The powder can be lightly wetted again with the Anti Bac and more powder applied to make a double layer of protective powder, and then finally apply Top Coat Sealer solution over powder and surrounding area. Allow sealer to dry off for at least 50 -60 seconds. That‚‚¾‚s it!</p>\n<p>Stage three:</p>\n<p>Return fish to pond. Avoid touching treatment area; hold fish in water near an air source venturi or air stone. If possible move fish back and forth to make gills move. It is possible to put a finger in the mouth of the fish to make the fish ‚‚¦gulp‚‚½ this can help resuscitation. Release fish when it can swim away unaided.</p>\n<p>Follow up:</p>\n<p>Hopefully this procedure will not have to be repeated. Though the procedure can be repeated if required, sedating fish is stressful and should be kept to a minimum. Keep a close eye on the wound, the dressing should last 3 To 5 days, after that, just apply the Anti Bac solution by bowling the fish then holding the wound site above the waterline. Once a week is adequate until a sign of new skin growth is evident, i.e. area goes white around the edges of the wound or the wound becomes light pink in colour as new tissue is being generated.</p>\n<p>Remember any chemical is a dangerous substance! Always wear surgical gloves when handling medications. Please read fully the statutory health and safety statements on each bottle.</p>\n<p>Spray bottles are supplied uncharged, 4-5 pumps maybe required before spray appears.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>MICROBE-LIFT NITE-OUT II is designed specifically for pond waters that contain marine life. Its highly specialized microbial consortium of nitrifying cultures is specially formulated to eliminate ammonia via a natural biological process termed nitrification. Remains active to 4°C! (Best results from 13°C and up).<br/>The cultures contained in MICROBE-LIFT NITE-OUT II will establish, promote or stabilize and maintain nitrification in pond waters, eliminating the toxic effect of ammonia. MICROBE-LIFT/NITE-OUT II liquid nitrifying bacteria contains select strains of Nitroso-monas, Nitrospira and Nitrobacter. Nitrosomonas convert ammonia to nitrite and Nitrobacter and Nitrospira convert nitrite to nitrate.<br/><br/>BENEFITS<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initiates nitrification super fast!</li>\n<li>Promotes stable nitrification.</li>\n<li>Provides stable cold weather nitrification.</li>\n<li>Safe for use around plants and animals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTES ON NITRIFICATION<br/>When ammonia removal is desired first start with MICROBE-LIFT Clean &amp; Clear to reduce the organic waste in the pond as high levels of BOD can inhibit nitrification by competing with the nitrifying microorganisms for necessary oxygen. After applying MICROBE-LIFT Clean &amp; Clear wait 24 to 48 hours to do its job, and then apply MICROBE-LIFT NITE-OUT II. Prior to the addition of NITE-OUT II (to start and maintain nitrification).<br/><br/>Check to make sure that the pond's pH is in the correct range for nitrification. Adjust the pond pH to a range of 7.5 to 8.7, and check to see if adequate alkalinity is present as you must maintain a level of at least 50/ppm of alkalinity at all times. This is necessary as nitrifying microorganisms use 7 parts of alkalinity for each part of ammonia removed (oxidized). If proper alkalinity is not present, nitrification will not occur, and if alkalinity<br/>is lost nitrification will cease and the pond pH will drop due to the nitrifying cultures activity. To increase alkalinity add AquaForte BioStabil or Kusuri Biobalance until you achieve an alkalinity level of 50/ppm to 100/ppm (minimum), and then maintain the alkalinity at a level of 50/ppm.</p>\n",

After applying MICROBE-LIFT Clean &amp; Clear wait 24 to 48 hours to do its job, and then apply MICROBE-LIFT NITE-OUT II. Prior to the addition of NITE-OUT II (to start and maintain nitrification).<br/>Check to make sure that the pond's pH is in the correct range for nitrification. Adjust the pond pH to a range of 7.5 to 8.7, and check to see if adequate alkalinity is present as you must maintain a level of at least 50/ppm of alkalinity at all times. This is necessary as nitrifying microorganisms use 7 parts of alkalinity for each part of ammonia removed (oxidized). If proper alkalinity is not present, nitrification will not occur, and if alkalinity<br/>is lost nitrification will cease and the pond pH will drop due to the nitrifying cultures activity. To increase alkalinity add AquaForte BioStabil or Kusuri Biobalance until you achieve an alkalinity level of 50/ppm to 100/ppm (minimum), and then maintain the alkalinity at a level of 50/ppm.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>Green Control - Completely organic - Safely removes algae - Free of algaecide</p>\n<p>Green Control is a completely natural product to combat algae and to control the water quality. Green Control is a product without the addition of any algaecide, zinc oxide or copper compounds. Green Control extracts the nutrients the algae need to grow from the water. Even a triple overdose will not harm fish or plants.<br/>Green Control is also suitable for swimming ponds and is harmless to humans and animals. Water turbidity clearly disappears with Green Control and thus contributes to crystal clear water. </p>\n<p>Working of Green Control:</p>\n<p>Special chelating agents absorb nutrients from the water and make them accessible to algae and aquatic plants. Even previously present deposits of heavy metals are dissolved and converted into a nutrient. In combination with the chelates, the fruit acids introduced create a stable carbonate hardness. When using Green Control, phosphate deposits are also bound, which are then made available to the algae as the carrier of the nutrient. The bound nutrient is absorbed by the algae and penetrates deep into the lime structure of the algae. This dissolves the lime structure of the algae, causing the algae to die. By using Green Control, the phosphate level of the water increases, which is caused by the binding of all the nutrients that are present in the water.

It is made of safe, non toxic, polymers and safely removes algae from ponds, creating a healthy ecosystem with clean, clear, beautiful water, where aquatic life can thrive.<br/><br/> Attached to a fountain, bubbler, aerator, the steps of a waterfall, or at the end of a filter system, the Pond Zinger‚ slowly dissolves, releasing its components into the pond where excess nutrients, such as Phosphorous, bind together and settle out.</p>\n<p><br/> The result is improved pond water quality in terms of clarity, reduced phosphates and algae, odor control, decreased suspended solids, and metal discoloration removal. The created sediments can be removed by the bacterial action of <a href=\"https://skswholesale.co.uk/products/microbe-lift-clean-and-clear-4ltr?_pos=10&amp;_sid=a4b414dd8&amp;_ss=r\" title=\"MicrobeLift Clean &amp; Clear - SKS Wholesale\">MicrobeLift Clean &amp; Clear</a>!<br/><br/> Independent studies have shown that the PONDZINGER‚ can remove up to 75-85% phosphorus from pond!<br/><br/> Once the water is clean, any remaining Pond Zinger‚ can be removed from the pond, dried, and then stored away from sunlight until it is needed again.

Therefore, it is important to add Malamix17 to your pond on a regular basis. This ideal mix of vitamins, herbal and plant extracts will increase the immune system of your fish in a significant way. The active ingredients of Malamix17 are absorbed through both the skin and the gills of the fish. They enhance the health of the skin and form the basis for a healthy mucus layer, which in turn provides an optimal natural defense against diseases.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>Malamix17 also contains nutrients/enzymes which enhance the filter bacteria and probiotics in your pond. This improves the water quality and protects your fish against ‘hole disease’.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How and when to use Malamix17:</em><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </span>To obtain an optimal mucus layer (and thus immunity),<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>it is advisable to administer Malamix17 every two to three months, from the moment the water temperature reaches 5°c. Malamix17 consists of purely biological components, which means that overdosing is not possible. Malamix17 is the ideal solution to restore water quality and cure the health of the mucus layer of your fish after a chemical treatment.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>What is the Water Cleanser?</p>\n<p>The Water Cleanser (TWC) is best described as a microbiological culture pad.<br/>If you look at TWC under a powerful microscope, it is full of millions of microscopic<br/>capillaries that progress from one end through to the other. These microscopic<br/>capillaries provide the ultimate home for all the required beneficial bacteria and<br/>microbes that maintain the health of water. TWC also provides the required trace<br/>elements for the microbes to thrive and function to their optimal levels whilst also<br/>providing the breeding trace elements for Archaea microbes and Bacillus bacteria<br/><br/>How does it work?<br/>Beneficial bacteria and microbes naturally break down and process organic waste (excess food, plant matter, dying algae, fish faeces, etc.) in water systems. Outside influences such as chemicals, pollutants, and fertilizers can disrupt the natural cycle and weaken the existing beneficial bacteria. The Water Cleanser (TWC) provides a protective habitat with all the required trace elements that allow the microbes to breed and multiply at their optimal rate. Once the microbes are re-established in the water system, they can then consume the organic waste at an accelerated rate, leaving the water cleaner and healthier, and requiring less maintenance.<br/><br/>Archaea microbes prefer to break down organic waste above oil but need hydrocarbon as an energy source to multiply. Archaea<span> </span>microbes are present in any body of water but remain inactive until they have a hydrocarbon source. The Water Cleanser is a<span> </span>hydrocarbon catalyst that creates the perfect conditions for these Archaea microbes.<br/></p>\n<p>Does TWC prevent algae?<br/>Yes! Excess nutrients in the water from organic waste can encourage overgrowth of algae, including algal blooms. The Water Cleanser accelerates proliferation of beneficial bacteria and microbes which consume that organic matter. Massive algal blooms require lots of nutrients; with their food source consumed by the microbes, the algae starves and dies.<br/><br/>The Water Cleanser has been tested for over 12 years and has a beneficial effect on all aquatic life. Besides that, the Water Cleanser can also be used in pools to lower the need for chemicals.</p>\n<p>Usage.<br/><span>Place The Water Cleanser in an area where the water flow is strongest. Where multiple blocks are being used, ensure that they are evenly spaced. Depending on existing water quality, full effects can be seen within 4-10 weeks.</span><br/><span>The 5 kg (11 lbs) Large block treats up to 500 sq. meters (5,500 sq. ft.) of surface area. </span><br/><span>The 1kg (2.2 lbs) Standard block treats up to 100 sq. meters (1,100 sq. ft.) of surface area. </span><br/><span>For cloudy or stagnant water, dosage can be increased. </span><br/><span>Replace every 6 months, leaving the old product in place for a one week overlap.</span></p>\n",

Every pond contains a certain amount of pathogens</em>: weaker fish are more susceptible to these dangers. The health of your fish starts with a healthy and strong mucus layer. Therefore, it is important to add Malamix17 to your pond on a regular basis. This ideal mix of vitamins, herbal and plant extracts will increase the immune system of your fish in a significant way. The active ingredients of Malamix17 are absorbed through both the skin and the gills of the fish. They enhance the health of the skin and form the basis for a healthy mucus layer, which in turn provides an optimal natural defense against diseases.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>Malamix17 also contains nutrients/enzymes which enhance the filter bacteria and probiotics in your pond. This improves the water quality and protects your fish against ‘hole disease’.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How and when to use Malamix17:</em><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> </span>To obtain an optimal mucus layer (and thus immunity),<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>it is advisable to administer Malamix17 every two to three months, from the moment the water temperature reaches 5°c. Malamix17 consists of purely biological components, which means that overdosing is not possible. Malamix17 is the ideal solution to restore water quality and cure the health of the mucus layer of your fish after a chemical treatment.</p>\n",

    "description_text": "\n<p>What is the Water Cleanser?</p>\n<p>The Water Cleanser (TWC) is best described as a microbiological culture pad.<br/> If you look at TWC under a powerful microscope, it is full of millions of microscopic<br/> capillaries that progress from one end through to the other. These microscopic<br/> capillaries provide the ultimate home for all the required beneficial bacteria and<br/> microbes that maintain the health of water. TWC also provides the required trace<br/> elements for the microbes to thrive and function to their optimal levels whilst also<br/> providing the breeding trace elements for Archaea microbes and Bacillus bacteria<br/><br/> How does it work?<br/> Beneficial bacteria and microbes naturally break down and process organic waste (excess food, plant matter, dying algae, fish faeces, etc.) in water systems. Outside influences such as chemicals, pollutants, and fertilizers can disrupt the natural cycle and weaken the existing beneficial bacteria. The Water Cleanser (TWC) provides a protective habitat with all the required trace elements that allow the microbes to breed and multiply at their optimal rate. Once the microbes are re-established in the water system, they can then consume the organic waste at an accelerated rate, leaving the water cleaner and healthier, and requiring less maintenance.<br/><br/> Archaea microbes prefer to break down organic waste above oil but need hydrocarbon as an energy source to multiply. Archaea microbes are present in any body of water but remain inactive until they have a hydrocarbon source. The Water Cleanser is a hydrocarbon catalyst that creates the perfect conditions for these Archaea microbes.<br/></p>\n<p>Does TWC prevent algae?<br/> Yes! Excess nutrients in the water from organic waste can encourage overgrowth of algae, including algal blooms. The Water Cleanser accelerates proliferation of beneficial bacteria and microbes which consume that organic matter. Massive algal blooms require lots of nutrients; with their food source consumed by the microbes, the algae starves and dies.<br/><br/> The Water Cleanser has been tested for over 12 years and has a beneficial effect on all aquatic life. Besides that, the Water Cleanser can also be used in pools to lower the need for chemicals.</p>\n<p>Usage.<br/></p>\n<li>\n<span>1 Block (200g) treats 265 gal.

The health of your fish starts with a healthy and strong mucus layer. Therefore, it is important to add Malamix17 to your pond on a regular basis. This ideal mix of vitamins, herbal and plant extracts will increase the immune system of your fish in a significant way. The active ingredients of Malamix17 are absorbed through both the skin and the gills of the fish. They enhance the health of the skin and form the basis for a healthy mucus layer, which in turn provides an optimal natural defense against diseases.<br/><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>Malamix17 also contains nutrients/enzymes which enhance the filter bacteria and probiotics in your pond. This improves the water quality and protects your fish against ‘hole disease’.</p>\n<p><em>How and when to use Malamix17:</em> To obtain an optimal mucus layer (and thus immunity),<br/>it is advisable to administer Malamix17 every two to three months, from the moment the water temperature reaches 5°c. Malamix17 consists of purely biological components, which means that overdosing is not possible. Malamix17 is the ideal solution to restore water quality and cure the health of the mucus layer of your fish after a chemical treatment.</p>\n",

Working under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, our ‘Satus organism’ can also degrade organic compounds which bacteria cannot. It has a higher metabolic rate that provides faster breakdown of organic wastes to prevent them building up in the aquarium.  </p>\n<p>Satus also contains a concentrated unique blend of heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms, including aerobic and anaerobic nitrifying bacteria that rapidly remove harmful ammonia and nitrite by converting them into nitrates, and will not produce hydrogen sulphide. This process prevents toxic ‘new tank syndrome’ providing a safer environment for your fish. Satus is harmless to all aquatic species including plants and cannot be overdosed. </p>\n<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shake bottle thoroughly before use.</li>\n<li>Turn off UV/ozone. Turn back on 2 hours after adding Satus.</li>\n<li>Calculate aquarium volume litres (length x width x depth (in cm)/1000). </li>\n<li>See label for full dose rate </li>\n<li>If dosage is maintained for the full 7 days, fish and other aquatic species can be added to the aquarium at any point. </li>\n<li>Add monthly for improved biofilter function and add; when introducing new fish, after each filter clean/water change, after treating the aquarium with medication. </li>\n<li>Keep out of reach of children.

Satus is harmless to all aquatic species including plants and cannot be overdosed. </p>\n<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shake bottle thoroughly before use.</li>\n<li>Turn off UV/ozone. Turn back on 2 hours after adding Satus.</li>\n<li>Calculate aquarium volume litres (length x width x depth (in cm)/1000). </li>\n<li>See label for full dose rate </li>\n<li>If dosage is maintained for the full 7 days, fish and other aquatic species can be added to the aquarium at any point. </li>\n<li>Add monthly for improved biofilter function and add; when introducing new fish, after each filter clean/water change, after treating the aquarium with medication. </li>\n<li>Keep out of reach of children. Store in a cool dry place. </li>\n<li>Satus cannot be used as a replacement for an aquarium filter but should be used alongside one.</li>\n</ul>\n",

While invisible to the naked eye, ammonia poses a significant threat to fish health. Fortunately, beneficial bacteria in the filter break down ammonia into less toxic nitrite, ensuring a safer environment for your aquatic companions.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Correct Ammonia Level:</strong> Zero tolerance for ammonia is crucial.

This mini kit is designed to test three crucial water parameters: pH, Nitrite, and Ammonia. Regular testing is essential to maintain the well-being of your fish and the overall health of your pond.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Understanding Ammonia:</strong> Ammonia, excreted by fish as a waste product, is extremely toxic. This kit helps you monitor ammonia levels, crucial for fish health, as it is broken down into less harmful nitrite by beneficial bacteria in the pond filter.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Understanding Nitrite:</strong> Nitrite is produced as beneficial bacteria break down harmful ammonia in the pond and filters. While less toxic than ammonia, elevated nitrite levels can still harm fish. Nitrite is further broken down into nitrate, which is less harmful to fish.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Understanding pH:</strong> The pH test in this kit measures the acidity or alkalinity of pond water on a scale from 0 to 14. It provides insights into whether your water is acidic, alkaline, or neutral. This information is vital for maintaining a suitable environment for aquatic life.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to Perform the Tests:</strong> This mini kit includes a comprehensive instruction leaflet that guides you through each parameter, their optimal ranges, and recommended actions if readings are outside those ranges. It's designed to be user-friendly, ensuring accurate and hassle-free testing.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Reported Concentrations for Compatibility:</strong> The test kit reports concentrations in terms of nitrogen (NH3-N) or (NO2-N), aligning with reported safe concentrations for fish and plants. If you're interested in the ionic concentration of the measured parameter, simply multiply the result by 1.21 (NH3-N) or 3.29 (NO2-N).</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Key Features:</strong></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Compact design for testing pH, Nitrite, and Ammonia.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Essential for maintaining excellent water quality in ponds.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">User-friendly instructions for accurate testing.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Compatible concentrations for fish and plants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Trust the NT Labs Pond Water Mini Test Kit for efficient and reliable testing of crucial parameters in your pond.

While essential for life, excess phosphate, not utilized by fish, can be excreted as waste or generated by the breakdown of organic matter. Elevated phosphate levels are often associated with the growth of nuisance algae, and while beneficial in small quantities, higher concentrations can disrupt the mineral balance within fish.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Why Test for Phosphate?</strong> Testing for phosphate is essential to monitor and control its concentration in the water, as increased levels contribute to nuisance algae growth. While low levels are generally safe for fish, monitoring phosphate prevents potential interference with the mineral balance in fish at higher concentrations.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What is the Correct Phosphate Level?</strong> The ideal phosphate concentration should be kept as close to zero as possible. Trace amounts between 0 and 0.25 mg/L PO4-P are sufficient for the healthy growth of higher plants.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What to Do if the Phosphate Level is Wrong:</strong></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Regular partial water changes with dechlorinated tap water can help maintain low phosphate levels.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Check the phosphate concentration in tap water to avoid accidental introduction.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Use Duckweed Control, a liquid solution, to bind phosphate and prevent excessive levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to Perform the Test:</strong></p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Ensure the test tube is clean.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Collect a 5 ml sample of pond water into the test tube.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Add 5 drops of the phosphate reagent, place the cap on the tube, and mix gently for a few seconds.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Wait for 5 minutes for the test to develop.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Remove the cap and look down through the test tube to determine the color.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Compare the color to the provided color chart to determine the phosphate concentration.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Maintain the optimal phosphate levels in your aquatic environment with NT Labs Phosphate Test.

While not typically toxic to fish, excessively high nitrate levels (&gt;100mg/l) can lead to growth issues.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What is the Correct Nitrate Level?</strong> The ideal nitrate level depends on factors like tap water quality, fish population, and feeding habits. Although nitrate is not typically harmful, high levels can promote algal growth. Ideally, a nitrate level of zero signifies a balance between fish waste and nutrient absorption by plant life, including algae.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">What to Do if the Nitrate Level is Wrong:</strong> Maintaining a constant zero nitrate level can be challenging. Regular water changes are key to diluting nitrate buildup. Pay attention to your tap water's nitrate level, as it contributes to the overall pond nitrate.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">How to Use the Nitrate Test:</strong></p>\n<ol data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Ensure the test tube is clean.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Collect a 5 ml water sample into the test tube.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">In well-lit conditions, turn Nitrate-1 upside down and shake vigorously until there is no sediment on the bottom.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Add 6 drops of Nitrate-1 and 6 drops of Nitrate-2. Replace the test tube cap and shake thoroughly.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Wait for 10 minutes, then compare the sample color to the provided color scale. A colorless sample indicates zero nitrate, while any hint of pink signals nitrate presence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Additional Information:</strong></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The test kit reports concentration in terms of nitrogen (NO3-N) for compatibility with reported safe concentrations for fish and plants.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\">If interested in the ionic concentration, multiply the result by 4.43 (NO3-N).</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Trust NT Labs Nitrate Test to accurately measure nitrate levels, providing you with the information needed to maintain a balanced pond environment.

With larger monthly dosages the bacteria that don’t find food will die. With small daily dosages more than 30 different species of living bacteria will enter the pond looking for food. The Dosatech can be used for dosing any liquid product like anti blanket weed products, phosphate binders, Ph+/Ph-products, etc. The neoprene hose makes it possible to add various types of solutions to the water of your pond.</span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">- 3-button operation and programming <br/></span><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">- Dosage up to 24 runs per day (max. 7,2 liter per day) <br/>- Dosage from 0 to 600 seconds per dosage (0,5 ml/second) <br/>- Continuous dosing possible with external control function <br/>- Easy to install and to maintain <br/>- Compact design <br/>- Easy to combine with other installations <br/>- Suction and injection nipples supplied (3/8\" male threaded)</span></p>\n",
